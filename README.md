# Deep-Co-clustering-improvisations
Final research project for CS-535(Deep Learning course) which describes our research approach for making some improvisations in the field of Deep Co-clustering

This is our extension to the original research done on DeepCC, which could be found here: https://github.com/DerronXu/Deep-Co-Clustering.
For implementation purposes, refer to that research paper on how to get started.

We extended that research to incorporate different types of autoencoders such as Sparse or Deep Autoencoders depending on the dataset type. More information about our research process, implementation and results could be found out in the report file labelled as CS535_final_report.pdf. 

Some of the screenshots of our result and model architecture could be found below:
